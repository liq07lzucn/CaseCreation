Case Creation
=============


This project creates a circular body 2-D test case to be used to try algorithms in Radiation Therapy
It is only meant to be used to test the efficiency of beamlet size discretization and aperture controled tomotherapy at
initial stages.

The dose is based on a simple exponentially decreasing function. No energy buildup at penetration of any kind and no
montecarlo engine behind it. This is only for the first stages of testing algorithms and these cases are not intended to
replace clinical cases
